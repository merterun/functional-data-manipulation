This is a part of Cool R Things series made purely for educational purposes. Contains both .rmd file and the notebook.

In this series i demonstrate various things that R allows us to do from web scraping, building dashboards, creating maps and many more.

This project explores the fundamentals of ```functional programming``` in R with the ```purrr``` library. I demonstrate how to transform and manipulate data structures in a more concise and efficient way using functions. Through this notebook, we will learn how to use the various functions provided by purrr to work with lists, vectors, and other data structures, and gain a deeper understanding of the functional programming paradigm in R.
